      <h2>Tropical Storm Bret (2017)</h2>
      <article class="grid-container1">
        <p>
          Tropical Storm Bret was the earliest named storm to develop in the
          Main Development Region of the Atlantic basin on record. Bret formed
          from a low-latitude tropical wave that had moved off the coast of
          Africa on June 12. The disturbance moved swiftly across the Atlantic
          for several days, steadily organizing despite its low latitude. On
          June 18, the organization increased enough for the National Hurricane
          Center (NHC) to begin issuing warnings disturbance while it was
          located southeast of the Windward Islands. The system continued to
          organize, and by the next day, it had developed into a tropical storm,
          the second of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. Bret continued
          moving swiftly to the west and struck Trinidad and Tobago early on
          June 20, before entering the Caribbean Sea, dissipating shortly
          afterwards. Starting in the 2017 season, the NHC changed its policy to
          allow tropical storm watches and warnings to be issued for tropical
          disturbances that do not yet satisfy the definition of a tropical
          cyclone but are expected to in short order while posing the threat of
          tropical-storm-force winds to landmasses. Thus, on June 18, although
          the vigorous tropical wave—the precursor to Bret—did not meet formal
          classification standards, the NHC began issuing advisories on what was
          considered a potential tropical cyclone. Bret left about $3 million
          (2017 USD) in damage and two deaths,[a] with both in Trinidad and
          Tobago.

            A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of
            Africa at a low-latitude on June 13. Although the wave was initially
            accompanied by a large area of showers and thunderstorms, convection
            diminished later the following day.[1] The National Hurricane Center
            (NHC) began discussing the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks
            (TWO) while the wave was located well south of Cabo Verde on June
            14, though any organization was expected to be slow as the system
            tracked swiftly westward.[2] Deep convection flared sporadically as
            the wave moved westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge
            situated to the north during the next few days.[1] On June 16,
            cloudiness associated with the feature began to show signs of
            organization.[3] ASCAT data around 12:00 UTC on June 18 indicated
            that a broad low pressure area developed, but lacked a well-defined
            circulation. A large area of 29 to 35 mph (47 to 56 km/h) winds was
            noted just north of the broad low.[1] At 21:00 UTC, the NHC issued
            their first-ever advisory on a potential tropical cyclone.[4]
            Despite winds of tropical storm-force, it was inconclusive whether
            the system possessed a closed low-level circulation.[5] Convection
            continued to increase on June 19, and around 18:00 UTC, a
            reconnaissance aircraft investigating the low found a well-defined
            center. As a result, the low became Tropical Storm Bret at this
            time, while situated about 185 mi (300 km) east-southeast of
            Trinidad.[1] The NHC began advisories on Bret three hours later.[6]
            Upon its formation, Bret became the earliest named storm on record
            in the Atlantic basin's main development region.[1] Also upon
            developing, the cyclone attained its minimum barometric pressure of
            1,007 mbar (29.7 inHg).[1] Bret moved swiftly westward towards
            Trinidad and Tobago at speeds of nearly 30 mph (48 km/h), an
            unusually fast pace for a tropical cyclone, especially at such a low
            latitude. The storm was not expected to intensify significantly or
            last long due to increasing vertical wind shear and land interaction
            with Venezuela.[6]

        <article>
          <h4>Southeastern Caribbean</h4>
          <p>
            On June 18, a tropical storm warning was raised for portions of the
            Windward Islands. This marked the first time a tropical storm
            warning was issued prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, following a
            change in NHC policy that enabled them to issue warnings on tropical
            disturbances if they posted a threat to land within 48 hours.[11]
            These were expanded to include portions of Venezuela and the ABC
            islands the following afternoon.[12] In anticipation of the storm,
            schools in Nueva Esparta suspended classes. Seafaring vessels were
            prohibited from leaving port.

            <p>
              In preparation for the storm, businesses across Trinidad and
              Tobago advised employees not involved in essential services to
              remain home, and schools were closed.[14] Community centers,
              schools, and churches were transformed into emergency shelters,
              with 72 shelters opened on Tobago alone.[15][16] Caribbean
              Airlines canceled its afternoon services, resulting in hundreds of
              stranded passengers.[14] Meanwhile, the Port Authority of Trinidad
              and Tobago canceled all ferry services.[17] The Health Ministries
              canceled all elective surgeries.[14]

              Trees were downed, roofs were blown off homes and businesses, and
              power lines were toppled as the storm approached the island.[15]
              Heavy rainfall from Bret flooded portions of South Trunk Road in
              Mosquito Creek, Trinidad.[18] Gusty winds also impacted Trinidad,
              with a gust of 66 km/h (41 mph) being observed at the Piarco
              International Airport, where 6.7 centimetres (2.6 in) of rainfall
              had also been recorded through the overnight hours of June
              19–20.[19] One man died in Trinidad after slipping off a makeshift
              bridge and hitting his head on June 20, which was slippery after
              rainfall from the tropical storm; thus it is classified as an
              indirect death.[20][21] In Tobago, a man died of his injuries a
              week after his house collapsed on him during June 21.[22] Damage
              from flooding in Barrackpore alone was reported to reach millions
              of dollars.[23] Hundreds of homes were affected by flooding, with
              some inundated by 0.9 to 1.21 m (3.0 to 4.0 ft) of water.[24] The
              medical records department of the Port-of-Spain General Hospital
              was temporarily closed after rainwater leaked into the
              structure.[25] Five schools suffered damage, with two remaining
              closed a week after the storm.[26] Total damage exceeded TT$20
              million (US$3 million).

          <h4>Venezuela</h4>
          <p>
            Heavy rainfall in Venezuela caused flooding along coastal areas of
            the country; schools were temporarily closed on Margarita
            Island.[32] Winds in excess of 75 km/h (45 mph) uprooted trees and
            caused structural damage across Margarita Island. Two people
            suffered storm-related injuries when a wall collapsed. Rough seas
            floundered boats, driving several onshore in Pampatar.[33] Large
            mudslides damaged or destroyed many homes. Approximately 800
            families were significantly affected in Miranda state, of whom 400
            lost their homes.[34] Across the country, 14,075 people were
            directly affected by the storm.[35] Following the storm,
            Venezuelanalysis claimed that President Nicolas Maduro approved
            US$19 million in emergency funds for relief efforts.[32] In Nueva
            Esparta, Venezuela's state-run radio claimed that 250 families were
            provided support to rebuild their homes,[36] and the multipurpose
            ship Tango 94 was dispatched to provide relief materials to
            Margarita Island.
